# Factory calculator

It is to calculate factory counts in factory games.

## Usage

It is not most optimal, but it gives per resource factory counts.

So you can have something making iron for example, and it will calculate how many iron factories you need to produce the needed amount of iron rods.

If iron rods are produced from 7,5 iron factories and iron plates are produced form 5,5 iron factories, it will give you 14 iron factories total not 13.

It is like this so you would not need to have productions for rods and plates in the same place.
